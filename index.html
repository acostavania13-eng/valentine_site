      Dear lil babita,<br><br>
      i love you so much and i miss you so much. I know you've been stressed out lately
      and have been working hard on your school work and because of that i wish to make
      you something that will cheer you up a little.
      <br><br>
      I worked on this by thinking of you and putting a smile on your face even if I'm far away.
      I know at the moment we are faraway and we cant give each other gifts but the distance
      wont stop me from making you little gifts and giving them to you!
      <br><br>
      My love, you have been the best boyfriend I could have ever asked for and because of that
      I want to ask you something.
    </p>
